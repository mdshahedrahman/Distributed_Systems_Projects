How to run the program:

------------------------



Before running the program, the machine must have numpy installed. Numpy can be installed using the following command from the Ubuntu terminal.



pip install numpy



Once numpy has been installed, we can activate the server by navigating to the assignment directory and activate ther server using the command:



python3 server.py



Then, the client can be activated by opening another terminal in the same directory and using the command:



python3 client.py



The client will connect to the server and perform the computations required by the assignment one by one and display the results in the terminal.
